Linux ftrace and its frontend trace-cmd can produce two different type of traces:

1. ASCII traces (.txt)
2. Binary traces (.dat)

While binary .dat traces cannot be read by human eyes, they are extremely useful when combined with a front-end that can graphically display them.
Examples in this respect are Kernelshark and TraceCompass (among others) ...
