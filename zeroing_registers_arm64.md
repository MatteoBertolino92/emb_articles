**Zeroing an Arm64 Register: a short overview**

Arm64, commonly known as AArch64, is the 64-bit extension of the Arm architecture. It brings numerous features and improvements over its predecessor, and among them is a variety of methods to zero a register. Here, we’ll explore these methods and we'll (very quickly) discuss the pros and cons of each.

### 1. **Using the `MOV` Instruction**:
```assembly
MOV X0, #0
```
- **Pros**:
  - **Readability**: It's clear and straightforward. Anyone reading the code immediately knows that the register X0 is being set to zero.
  - **Universality**: This method works across various Arm architectures, not just Arm64.

- **Cons**:
  - **Code Size**: It can potentially take more space than other zeroing methods.

### 2. **Using the `EOR` Instruction (Exclusive OR)**:
```assembly
EOR X0, X0, X0
```
This technique utilizes the XOR operation where a value XORed with itself always results in zero.

- **Pros**:
  - **Efficiency**: It’s a single instruction, which can be a fast way to zero out a register.
  - **Versatility**: Apart from zeroing, the `EOR` instruction can be useful in a variety of other bit-manipulation operations.

- **Cons**:
  - **Readability**: Not as immediately obvious as the MOV method. Those unfamiliar with the behavior of XOR might not immediately recognize this as a zeroing technique.

### 3. **Using the `SUB` Instruction (Subtraction)**:
```assembly
SUB X0, X0, X0
```
Here, we're subtracting the register from itself, resulting in zero.

- **Pros**:
  - **Simplicity**: Like the EOR method, it’s a single instruction.
  
- **Cons**:
  - **Readability**: Again, it's not as transparent as the MOV method.

### 4. **Using the `AND` Instruction with a Zero Operand**:
```assembly
AND X0, X0, #0
```
Logically ANDing anything with zero always results in zero.

- **Pros**:
  - **Explicitness**: It’s evident that you're zeroing the register.

- **Cons**:
  - **Efficiency**: It’s not the most efficient way to zero out a register due to the immediate operand. Also, modern compilers would typically not generate this code for zeroing a register.

### 5. **Zeroing using Extended Register Names**:
```assembly
MOV W0, #0  // zeros the lower 32-bits, upper 32-bits remain unchanged
```

- **Pros**:
  - **Partial Zeroing**: Handy when you want to clear only a portion of a register.
  
- **Cons**:
  - **Incomplete**: Doesn't zero out the full 64-bit register.

### **Conclusion**:

Zeroing a register is a fundamental operation in assembly programming, and Arm64 offers multiple ways to achieve this. The method you choose largely depends on your specific requirements and context:

- For **clarity and readability**, the `MOV` instruction is a winner.
- For **compactness and efficiency**, the `EOR` and `SUB` methods shine.
